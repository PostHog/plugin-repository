# [DEPRECATED] Plugins

This repository lists plugins that are available for PostHog. Plugins enable customization of your PostHog instance, providing tools for doing things like getting data in and out of PostHog, as well as running scheduled jobs.

This repository is the source for the in-app plugin library as well as our website's [Plugins page](https://posthog.com/plugins).
## Adding a plugin to this directory

Please create a pull request submitting an edit to the [`repository.json`](https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-repository/blob/main/repository.json) file.

For the 'maintainer' field, add 'official' if you are part of the PostHog team, and 'community' otherwise.

For the plugin URL, we support GitHub, GitLab, and `npm` URLs. GitHub is preferred.
## Installing a plugin
