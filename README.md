# Plugins

This repository lists plugins that are available for PostHog. Plugins enable customization of your PostHog instance.

## Adding a plugin to this directory

Please create a pull request submitting an edit to the [plugins JSON](https://github.com/PostHog/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json).

For the 'maintainer' field, add 'official' if you are part of the PostHog team, and 'community' otherwise.

If your plugin is written in JavaScript, feel free to use the GitHub, GitLab, or npm URL. However, if it is TypeScript-based, please include the npm URL so PostHog knows where to fetch the compiled JS files from.

## Installing a plugin

Find the "Plugins" page in PostHog and select the repository plugin from the list.

Alternatively, use the [PostHog CLI](https://github.com/posthog/posthog-cli) to globally install a plugin.

## Creating a new plugin

We'll update the PostHog main docs (posthog.com/docs) with instructions on how to do this.
